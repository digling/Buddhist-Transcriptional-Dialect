# Buddhist-Transcriptional-Dialect
This is a repository of resources related to the study of Chinese historical phonology using the evidence of the transcription of Indic terms in Chinese Buddhist texts. 

## Proposed work flow
* Step 1: Digitize Coblin materials (esp. Coblin1983)
* Step 2: Mark T.184 as apocraphal with appropriate citations. 
* Step 3: Clean up Coblin1983 by incorporating the proposal that Nattier makes in hand written notes on her copy of Coblin1983. I have asked her what year she made these notations so that we can better keep track of it bibliographically. 
* Step 4: Digitize Nattier's Zhi Qian glossary. 
* Step 5: Digitize Karashima2010.
* Step 6: Incorporate further glosses not given in Coblin1983. 
 * Step 6.1: Include Antonello's text (T.731)
 * Step 6.2: Include translations by An Shigao and Lokakṣema listed in the appendix of Nattier2008 but not in Coblin1983. 
 * Step 6.3: Include translations by An Shigao not included in the Taishō canon discovered in the 1990s discussed by Stephano Zacchetti. 

## Datasets under discussion for digitization

* Coblin1982
* Coblin1983
* Coblin1993a
* Coblin1993b
* Schuessler2014


# An alternative proposal for work flow (using a “text-centric” approach)

*	compile a complete list of all the texts that can be considered, at the present state of our knowledge, to be genuine Han-period translations < I can do this fairly quickly, there are no substantive updates to the list in my Guide >

*	add notes on any works in this group that appear to consist of more than one layer (e.g., T418, where the verse and prose are of different dates) so that the data can be sorted appropriately in chronological terms (perhaps factoring in Antonello’s very suggestive idea about an “interim period” of translation at Xuchang 許昌 between 196 and 220)   < Paul, Stefano and I could probably do this >

*	recruit specialists on these materials to simply go through digital copies of each text and underline all of the transcriptions they see there  < the usual suspects >

*	communicate to these specialists that notes on the meanings of the terms, any evidence the transcriptions might provide concerning the language of the Indian source-text, possible corruptions that may have taken place in the course of scribal transmission, and so on, are NOT REQUIRED but would of course be welcome

*	with the terms identified by these scholars in hand, hire a research assistant to type in the reconstructed pronunciations of the Chinese characters in these transcriptions as given by Coblin, Pulleyblank, Schuessler and any others deemed relevant [still treating them as complete words at this stage]  < somebody with good knowledge of Chinese and a high tolerance for the IPA! >

*	either now or at a later stage, hire a research assistant to add to each term any discussions found in (1) Karashima 2010, (2) Nattier ZQ Glossary c. 2003 [with updates by the author], and (3) elsewhere in other scholarly publications*

* finding and tabulating the latter will be a very large and ongoing task, and it should not be considered essential before the above findings are made available to colleagues

*	forward the list of transcriptions (with reconstructed pronunciations) to Stefan Baums and any other interested Indologists for their comments and suggestions

* hire a research assistant to add Gāndhārī counterparts where available < ideally a graduate student who is a Gāndhārī specialist >

*	incorporate any comments from Baums and others on these terms

*	hire a research assistant to combine all the materials received from the above contributors and to sort them into at least three formats:  (1) a pinyin-based registry of all the transcription characters found in these texts (single-character based, with entries documenting the multi-character terms in which these transcription characters occur; for specialists in Chinese phonology), (2) a pinyin-based dictionary of complete words (for Buddhism specialists who want to actually read the texts), and (3) a Sanskrit-based index (for Buddhologists who want to find the Chinese counterpart[s] to Indic-language terms).  Eventually you may want to add a fourth section, tabulating the transcription characters according to rhyme groups (as in Schuessler 2009).

## things that may not need doing (at least at this stage):

* Since the focus in this project will be only on characters used in Buddhist transcriptions (and initially, only those appearing in Han-period translations), and since the entries will absorb the relevant material found in Coblin, Karashima, Nattier and others (as indicated above), it may not be necessary to digitize the entirety of Coblin‘s work 

* Likewise for Karashima 2010, since only the transcription terms (and not the entire lexicon) will be relevant to this project.
