# Buddhist-Transcriptional-Dialect
This is a repository of resources related to the study of Chinese historical phonology using the evidence of the transcription of Indic terms in Chinese Buddhist texts. 

## Proposed work flow
* Step 1: Digitize Coblin materials (esp. Coblin1983)
* Step 3: Clean up Coblin1983 by incorporating the proposal that Nattier makes in hand written notes on her copy of Coblin1983. I have asked her what year she made these notations so that we can better keep track of it bibliographically.
