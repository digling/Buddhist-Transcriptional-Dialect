# Buddhist-Transcriptional-Dialect
This is a repository of resources related to the study of Chinese historical phonology using the evidence of the transcription of Indic terms in Chinese Buddhist texts. 

## Proposed work flow
* Step 1: Digitize Coblin materials (esp. Coblin1983)
* Step 2: Mark T.184 as apocraphal with appropriate citations. 
* Step 3: Clean up Coblin1983 by incorporating the proposal that Nattier makes in hand written notes on her copy of Coblin1983. I have asked her what year she made these notations so that we can better keep track of it bibliographically. 
* Step 4: Digitize Nattier's Zhi Qian glossary. 
* Step 5: Digitize Karashima's glossary. REFER TO IT BY BIBTEX KEY
* Step 6: Incorporate further glosses not given in Coblin1983. 
 * Step 6.1: Include Antonello's text (T.731)
 * Step 6.2: Include translations by An Shigao and Lokakṣema listed in the appendix of Nattier2008 but not in Coblin1983. 
 * Step 6.3: Include translations by An Shigao not included in the Taishō canon discovered in the 1990s discussed by Stephano Zacchetti.
